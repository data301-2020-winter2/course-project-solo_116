## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
League of Legends (LOL) is a popular online competitive game published by Riot Games company. In the game, there are two teams (blue and red) on two sides of the map trying to destroy the opponent’s nexus to win the game. Each team has five players, and there are many factors which may be related to win the game. As a player of LOL, I am highly interested to analysis such factors so that I can have a better understanding to win my next game in LOL. I speculate that columns “first blood”, “first Baron”, “first dragon”, “team kills”, “team death”, “team assistance”, “team total gold”, “team total champion damage”, and “team total heal” have relationships to “team win”. Some more analysis, for example, “ignoring all other factors, one side is more likely to win the game” may be hold as well. A dashboard can be built for this dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The dataset is created by *Minyong Shin* using Riot API on April 20th, 2020. This dataset includes 107125 observations of LOL game under master rank. It records many factors related to the game including “game duration”, “team win”, first blood”, “first Baron”, “first dragon”, “Baron kills”, “team kills”, “team death”, “team assistance”, “team total gold”, “team total champion damage”, “team total heal”, “team total level”, “team ward placed”, “team ward kill”, “team average level”, etc. If one team takes the first of one object, for example, first blood is recorded as 1, the other team for sure will lose it and record it as 0. It is a public interest to find out which factors have a relationship to win the game. Also, the strong of each relationship can also be analysed. One potential drawback of this project using this dataset is that because this game is updating from time to time, the same analysis may need to be done with the updated data each year.
